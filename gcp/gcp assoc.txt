->A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure large amounts of structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. Even if the data comes from on-premises, cloud, or edge-computing systems
Project:
    ->Project IDs are immutable and can be set only during project creation.
    ->The only fields that can be updated are the project name and labels.
    =>Editor role: Cannot transfer project ownership - Cannot assign the Owner role to other users - Cannot enable or disable APIs - Cannot view audit logs.
    =>Be aware that the setIamPolicy permission for organization, folder, and project resources allows the user to grant all other permissions, and so should be assigned with care.
->Vcpu to core ratio:
    ->If virtual machines consistently experience high "CPU ready" times (waiting for resources), it may be time to reduce the ratio.
    ->Conversely, consistently low CPU usage indicates potential for cost savings by increasing the ratio.
-> A command consist of group, sub group, positional arguments, flags(required, optional),..
->You can use Cloud Identity to manage your users, apps, and devices from a central locationâ€”the Google Admin console.
->Disabling a service's API access does not delete the underlying data which will continue to be billed. 
->If you attempt to disable a service that other enabled services depend on, the call will fail.
    ->Set the disable_dependent_services parameter on the services.disable request to true.
    ->Use --force to disable dependant services.
    ->Use --async to continue executing other commands in parallel.
-> If you want to view and monitor the metrics collected by multiple Google Cloud projects(in diff orgs or aws acc), then you need to configure Cloud Monitoring.
-> You can close an active Cloud Billing account to stop all billable services in any projects.
-> Cloud Billing export to BigQuery enables you to export detailed Google Cloud billing data (such as usage, cost estimates, and pricing data) automatically.
->Use the Rebilling data export to manage billing operations for your Google Cloud customers.
->No, you cannot create a single VPC that spans across different regions in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
->max-surge and max-unavailable are flags used during managed instance group rolling updates to control the scaling behavior and maintain service availability while deploying new application versions.
	->max-surge:Specifies the maximum number of additional instances of the new version that can be created before terminating instances of the old version.
	->max-unavailable:Specifies the maximum number of healthy instances of the old version that can be terminated at any given time during the update.
->A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of the data in a specific resource.(VM disk, firestore, big query)
->commited(1-3 yrs) discount:70%, sustainable use:(20-50)%.
->spot VM(no max run time) is like preemptible VM(24hrs max runtime).
->Preemptible VM's can not be migrated to regular VM.
->cloud load balancing can distribute traffic across multiple regions.
->Cloud Run is a managed compute platform that lets you run containers directly on top of Google's scalable infrastructure.
    ->Cloud Run services. Used to run code that responds to web requests, or events.
    ->Cloud Run jobs. Used to run code that performs work (a job) and quits when the work is done.
->Deploy app in appengine from GCP:
    ->Prepare your app: Ensure your app is structured correctly for App Engine, with necessary files like app.yaml (configuration) and requirements.txt (dependencies).
    ->gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=v3=.5,v2=.5 (to split traffic b/w different versions)
->External load balancing is for users from internet. Interanal load balancing is for clients inside cloud.
->Anthons: Manages container across multiple environments(cloud tun, gke, edge, on-prem...).
->Cloud function Gen2 they run on cloud run so they support multi function, concurrent requests and traffic splitting.
->Snapshots stores specific point in time state(data) of (disk/file/table/dataBase).
    ->They can be shared across projects or with other cloud providers.
    ->We don't lose data by deleting old snapshots.
->Machine image is created from boot disk.
    ->Can create multi regional images.
->Disk size can only be increased can not be decreased.
->Cloud storage
    ->Standard: Frequent 
    ->Nearline: <1 a month(min duration) (backups)
    ->Coldline: <1 a quater(min duration) (disaster recovery)
    ->Archive: <1 a year(min duration) (digital preservation)
->Persistent disks are used to store dataBase.
->Types of storages GCP:https://cloud.google.com/products/storage/?userloc_155420-network_o&&hl=en
