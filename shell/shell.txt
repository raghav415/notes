File permission format:
	->All linux files belong to an owner and a group.
	->-rwxr-xr--.	# this is example of permissions on a file/dir.
		->-		# file type, - indicates normal file if it is d it indicates dir there are other file types as well.
		->rwx	# first set applies to owner of file.
		->r-x	# second set applies to user grp that owns the file.
		->r--	# third set applies to others.
		->.		# for Extended attributes.
Commands:
	->cmnd_name --help # will list flags avail for command
	->cd
	->pwd
	->ls	# only names of files and directories present in pwd will be listed.
		->ls /dir1/		# lists files and directories present in dir1 which is in pwd.
		->-l	# for long listing format(inc permission info).
	->cp src_file dest_file		# copies file.
	->mv src_file dest_file		# moves file, renames file if same dir is used.
	->rm file_name		# permanently deletes file.
	->cat file_name		# shows content of file (it concatentes file with terminal).
	->less file_name 	# same as cat but closes and opens new window to show content of file.
	->more file_name		# can view/stream content of file using down arrow instead of all at once.
	->grep search_text	# can be used to search the file or command.
		->mv --help|grep verbose	# searches for word verbose in mv --help output.
	->touch file.txt file2.txt 	# used to create files.
	->mkdir dir2 # creates dir.
	->chmod	+wx file_name	# Adds write and executable permision, (helps in changing permissions).
		->chmod ug+rw,o+r filename 	# Adding read and write permissions to the owner and group, and read-only permissions to others.
		->chmod 777 file_name
			->Each digit represents permission for owner, group, others.
			->Each digit can have value from 0(---: 000) to 7(rwx: 111) indicating 3 binary values.
		->File created using shell has only permissions to read.
