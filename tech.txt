Synchronous replication:Ensures data consistency between source and target databases by waiting for target to confirm the receipt of data before the write operation is considered complete.
Asynchronous replication:Does not ensure data consistency as the write operation is considered complete before the data is copied to the target database.
Semi Synchronous replication:Balances performance and data consistency by waiting for a certain time period or amount of data before copying it to the target database.
DNS Records:
    ->Address Mapping record (A Record)—stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv4 address.
    ->IP Version 6 Address record (AAAA Record)—stores a hostname and its corresponding IPv6 address.
    ->Canonical Name record (CNAME Record)—can be used to alias a hostname to another hostname.
    ->NS record—identifies a name server responsible for the resolution of queries for a particular hostname.
    
ORMs typically use JDBC/ODBC drivers under the hood to communicate with the database.
    ->JDBC/ODBC Translate your programming language calls (e.g., Java methods in JDBC) into database-specific queries we use SQL like syntax.
    ->ORM we control DB using objects.
